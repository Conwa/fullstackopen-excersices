# The way I organized the repository was to copy the public and src folders; and the README, .gitignore, package.json and package-lock.json files to the folder indicating the requested exercises, since the creation of create-react-app for each exercise requires a lot of storage space when importing all the node_modules required by React and I was not able to use PNPM to create shallow copies of the required directories.
